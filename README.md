In the main there i commands where you can change the String input to add what you would like. If I had more time, I would have let user input it or have it in the test cases. Once you add input, just click run in the main and it will give you the output

        List<String> commands = Arrays.asList(
                "CREATE fruits",
                "CREATE vegetables",
                "CREATE grains",
                "CREATE fruits/apples",
                "CREATE fruits/apples/fuji",
                "LIST",
                "CREATE grains/squash",
                "MOVE grains/squash vegetables",
                "CREATE foods",
                "MOVE grains foods",
                "MOVE fruits foods",
                "MOVE vegetables foods",
                "LIST",
                "DELETE fruits/apples",
                "DELETE foods/fruits/apples",
                "LIST"
        );
